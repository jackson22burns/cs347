 <h1>Getting Started</h1>
 <p>
     While I've learned that simple html and css suffice to create basic web pages. I became curious whether there are any additional resources for already-developed elements of websites. While researching some industry standards and resources that are most widely used within UX, I came across bootstrap and material UI. 
</p>
 <p>
     The biggest difference between these resources is that Material UI is used in conjunction with react (which has also become industry standard), while bootstrap can be used with just html. However both these two giants in the web development industry help developers design better websites with great UI, excellent user experience, and responsive designs. They do this by offering previously styled web elements and classes for the developer to make use of.
